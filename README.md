# Surfs Up

## Overview
We are using SQLite and pandas to help W.Avy analyze temperature data to decided whether or not it would be a good idea to open a "Surf n' Shake" shop.

December Results

- December's higher standard deviation indicates that the temperature changes more than June
- June had a much higher min and a slightly higher max temperature than December
- Both month had relatively close mean temperatures (71.04 vs 74.9)

## Summary

Overall it looks like Hawaii has a relatively stable temperature when comparing June and December. Although, December seems to fluctuate a bit more, the mean stays pretty close in both months. However, this analysis did not go through the precipitation data for both months which could have an effect on traffic as people are less likely to go surfing when it's raining. Also, this data has not been filtered to check how active the stations were which could scew the data as inactive stations may not accurately reflect the weather in that area.
